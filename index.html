                <h2>Why I Chose Web Development</h2>
                <p class="date">October 6, 2024 by Ashley Chung - Fah</p>
                <p>Web development caught my interest because it combines creativity with problem-solving in a way that few other fields do. I love the process of designing something from the ground up and being able to see my progress immediately. Learning how websites are built—from the structure with HTML, to the styling with CSS, and then bringing it all to life with JavaScript—has been a rewarding experience. It’s fascinating to see how much detail goes into creating a seamless, user-friendly experience on the web.</p>
                <p>What excites me most about web development is the constant evolution of the field. There’s always something new to learn, whether it's mastering new frameworks, exploring responsive design, or improving accessibility for a wider audience. Each of these challenges pushes me to be a better developer and motivates me to keep expanding my skillset.</p>

                <h2>My Journey in Web Development</h2>
                <p class="date">October 6, 2024 by Ashley Chung - Fah</p>
                <p>My journey started with basic web design, where I learned to create simple, static websites using HTML and CSS. As I advanced, I dove deeper into JavaScript, which allowed me to make sites interactive and more engaging. This step-by-step learning process has taught me the importance of both patience and persistence, as each new skill builds on the last. Along the way, I’ve worked on personal projects that challenge my abilities, like building a responsive portfolio and experimenting with different layouts and animations.</p>
                <p>I’m also exploring backend development and learning how databases and servers interact with the front end. My goal is to become proficient in full-stack development, which will allow me to handle both the front and back ends of web applications. This holistic approach gives me the ability to create complete solutions from start to finish, which is a key part of my long-term goals in web development.</p>
